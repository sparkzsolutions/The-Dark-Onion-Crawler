# The-Dark-Onion-Crawler
A comprehensive dark web crawler to detect child abusive contents in the dark web. 

THE DARK ONION CRAWLER – Through our extensive research we were able to come up with an WebCrawler that has the capability to navigate and track dark web Marketplaces and .onion websites that act as the breeding ground for criminal activities that involve child abuse. The crawler will also be integrated with a specially designed software module that will be able to detect and keep tracks when ever new child abuse contents are uploaded or reupdated. Thereby we are trying to create a decisive crawler that will have the ability to mimic the activities of a normal user thereby ensuring its anonymity while it goes on executing the task it was designed for.

With our limited experience with dark web and by studying various attempts by international organizations like FBI to counter crimes in dark web, we were able to identify that due to the extensive reach of anonymity that makes dark web so vicious it becomes really hard to catch the culprits behind these heinous crimes. That doesn’t mean that we are completely helpless through our solution we aim to keep an constant look out for child abusive contents in the dark web and as  soon as we get an update regarding an new upload or repost we can take adhesive measures to bring down the uploaded content before its viewed or shared by numerous pedophiles out there. The main reason that leads to the spread of child abusive content in the dark web is the fact that as soon as a content is uploaded it finds its ways into various other platforms, Therefore the pivotal aim of our system is to take such contents down as soon as possible.   

Focusing on our software solution we designed the algorithm to focus on the following :-

Video analyzation :- Under this domain we shall be focusing on nudity analyzers, Private body part detection using deep learning, Blood and harmful object detections and body size ratios analyzations .

Audio analyzation :- Using advance audio frequency analyzers , the system will be able to differentiate age groups based on their voice frequencies , detect violence and analyze emotions with support of facial feature recognitions.

NLP :- We shall be incorporating advance NLP algorithms to detect the use of “Hot words” in video headings and chat rooms, moreover the system will also be able to detect the use of encoded messages  

A major breakthrough we were able to find during our initial stages of development was that as the pandemic progressed the number of users in the dark web have increased manifoldly and thereby at the moment we believe that we will be able train our crawler in such a way that it mimics the actions of a new user and thereby keeping its anonymity strong.
